- [ ] Smaller center circle on iPad
- [ ] Migrate the mobile labels to the desktop carousel
- [ ] Improve loading animation and experience
- [ ] Add some sort of scrolling callout, or some sort of guided tour after loading that shows the user how to use the app
- [ ] Highlighting someone's face (either by mouse hover on desktop or by selecting on the mobile carousel) will cause the corresponding tile to highlight as well, without scrolling or anything
- [ ] Improve setup page: Add LinkedIn profile input field and description editor with face previews during person setup. Use session storage to preserve form data if user navigates away.
- [x] Fix iPhone auto-cycle visibility: On page refresh after panning, the carousel auto-cycle is not visible until the next page change. Occurs on all subsequent refreshes.
